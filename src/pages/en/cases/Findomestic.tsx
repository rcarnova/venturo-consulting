            "With social media growth — particularly Facebook — Findomestic found itself like many finance companies handling customer service requests through public channels. The marketing team managing social became the first point of contact for requests requiring actual customer service intervention. The problem: when customer service stepped in, they used formal, procedural corporate language that clashed with social's conversational tone, creating perceived inconsistency and lowering community trust.",
