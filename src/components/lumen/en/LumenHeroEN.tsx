            Organizational culture is like water for those swimming in it: invisible precisely because
            it's everywhere. People breathe its unwritten rules every day, but struggle to name them.

            That's why Lumen doesn't use only questionnaires or only interviews. It combines narrative
            techniques - one-to-one interviews, oblique questions, storytelling workshops - to surface
            stories. And in stories, culture reveals itself on its own.

            The result is not a judgment. It's a mirror. A faithful image of how people actually
            experience the organization, not how they think they should experience it.
