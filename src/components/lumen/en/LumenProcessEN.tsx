            Not an 80-page report that ends up in a drawer. Lumen produces a <strong>narrative mirror</strong>:
            a 15-25 page document in which the organization's people recognize their own voice,
            their own stories, their own tensions - and finally understand why certain things never change,
            despite good intentions.
          </p>
          <p className="text-foreground leading-relaxed">
            More important than the mirror is what happens after: the <strong>priority levers map</strong> with
            2 concrete 3-month projects that the organization carries forward autonomously or with Venturo support.
