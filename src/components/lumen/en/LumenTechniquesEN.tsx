    note: "Reveals perceived culture vs. declared culture. The informality of the scene dissolves the defensive filter.",
  },
  {
    title: "The permitted mistake",
    question: "Think about the last time something went wrong - a bad decision, a project that didn't work out. How did it end?",
    note: "Illuminates tolerance for failure and the real relationship with accountability.",
  },
  {
    title: "The new colleague",
    question: "If you had to explain to a new colleague the 'unwritten' things - the ones they'll never find in the manual - what would you tell them?",
    note: "Surfaces basic assumptions, Schein's third layer, the hardest to reach.",
  },
  {
    title: "The move",
    question: "If your company were to relocate, what would you bring with you and what would you leave behind - both physical and abstract?",
    note: "Reveals valued artifacts, real values, and what is tolerated but not loved.",

  {
    title: "The last decision",
    question: "Think about the last important decision made in the company - how did you find out about it?",
    note: "Reveals real power systems, communication channels, perceived inclusion.",

    note: "Reveals real recognition systems and emotional coherence.",
